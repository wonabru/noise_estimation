# Compiling from source:

      cd estera_c
      make

# Usage:

      Edit `Estera_lim.conf`
      change `!NO_FILES!` to number of filename in `datafilename.dat`
      Edit `datafilenames.dat` and put in column all filenames which you would like to calculate noise
      Each file with data should have only one column of data.
      
      run `Estera_lim`
      
# Simplified version in python

      python3 estera.py
